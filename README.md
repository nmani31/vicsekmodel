# vicsekmodel

This code yields a visual, quantitative portrayal of bacterial motion through the mathematical Vicsek model defined at the following link (http://web.mit.edu/8.334/www/grades/projects/projects10/Hernandez-Lopez-Rogelio/dynamics_2.html). The code should yield both a Vortex Order Parameter (denoted by phi) and a visual representation of the organization or chaos of particulate motion.
